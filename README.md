## Overview

This project leverages **robosuite**, a simulation framework for robotic manipulation, in combination with **Stable Baselines3 (SB3)** to train and evaluate a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent for the **Pick-and-Place** task. The agent learns to autonomously pick up objects and place them in designated locations within a simulated environment.

## Features

- **Robosuite Integration**: Utilizes the `PickPlace` task in robosuite with the Panda robot.
- **Stable Baselines3 SAC**: Implements the SAC algorithm for efficient and stable training.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatically saves the best-performing models during training.
- **GPU Support**: Configured to utilize CUDA-enabled GPUs for accelerated training.
- **Evaluation and Demonstration**: Provides functionalities to evaluate the trained agent and visualize its performance.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters**: Allows tweaking of SAC hyperparameters for optimized performance.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **CUDA**: If utilizing GPU acceleration, ensure CUDA is installed and compatible with your GPU and PyTorch version.
- **NVIDIA GPU**: A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU for hardware acceleration (optional but recommended).
